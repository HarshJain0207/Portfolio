            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I have completed my B.Tech in Information Technology from JECRC in June 2025. I am a passionate programmer with a strong foundation in web development and software engineering. Proficient in HTML, CSS, Node.js, Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), Database Management System (DBMS), Object-Oriented Programming System (OOPs) and C++, I possess a versatile skill set that enables me to tackle a wide range of technical challenges. With a keen eye for design and a dedication to innovation, I love creating new, attractive, and creative websites. My work is driven by a desire to blend functionality with aesthetics, ensuring that each project not only meets but exceeds user expectations.
               I am currently learning Salesforce to expand my capabilities in cloud-based solutions and customer relationship management. I am continually exploring new technologies and methodologies to stay at the forefront of the ever-evolving digital landscape. Whether it's developing responsive web applications or crafting elegant solutions to complex problems, my commitment to excellence remains unwavering.</p>
